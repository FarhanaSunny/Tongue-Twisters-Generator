# Tongue-Twisters-Generator
This is a fun and a very user friendly app. It can used by any age group , whether for individual educational(someone learning a new language) or fun activity. Also in a setting where people taking turn in a fun group game. I had so much fun making the app and I know you will have fun giving the app a try too 😊

<b>---Please make sure to click on the Play button in the twister cards, you will be pleasantly surprised to hear the sweet voice of my 5 years old daughter's voice😉❤️---</b>

# Motivation:
When I was told to make my first app for GetCoding, honestly it felt intimidating!! As I have only worked with html and CSS before . So I started this project using mostly JavaScript. All the tongue twisters of the app coming from javaScript made this app so easy to manoeuvre, for examples I can add as many tongue twisters as I want in future. As all the templates has been set already using 'Foreach loop, appendchilds, eventlistners' etc. Overall it was very engaging learning curve for me ✌🏼

The inspiration behind crreating this particular app definitely comes from my daughter , as I wanted to create something for her. Adding her sweet voices saying all these non native languages surly made this app extra special 👩‍👧❤️❤️
