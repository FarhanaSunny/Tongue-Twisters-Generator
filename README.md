# Tongue-Twisters-Generator

"This is a fun and very user-friendly app. It can be used by any age group, whether for individual education (someone learning a new language) or as a fun activity. It's also great in a setting where people take turns in a fun group game. I had so much fun making the app, and I know you will enjoy giving it a try too! 😊"

<b>---Please make sure to click on the Play button in the twister cards, you will be pleasantly surprised to hear the sweet voice of my 5 years old daughter's voice😉❤️---</b>

# Motivation:

When I was tasked with creating my first app for GetCoding, it honestly felt intimidating! Having only worked with HTML and CSS before, I decided to embark on this project primarily using JavaScript. The plethora of functionalities that JavaScript offers made maneuvering through the app surprisingly easy. For instance, I can effortlessly add as many tongue twisters as I want in the future, thanks to the templates set up using 'forEach' loops, 'appendChilds', event listeners, and more. Overall, it has been a very engaging learning curve for me! ✌🏼

The inspiration behind crreating this particular app definitely comes from my daughter , as I wanted to create something for her. Adding her sweet voices saying all these non native languages surly made this app extra special 👩‍👧❤️❤

# Description: 

<li>Two Dropdown options for the twisters</li>
<li>One showcasing four different languages for language option</li>
<li>Other option is for three difficulty settings</li>
<li>Each tongue twisters has a play button demonstrating how the twisters should sound like</li>

# Acknowledgements:

I am very grateful to have Mitchell Hynes as my first coach for my initial project. Without his consistent support, I wouldn't have been able to finish this project. He kept me motivated and encouraged me throughout the entire process with his great patience and deep knowledge of software development. 🤗
