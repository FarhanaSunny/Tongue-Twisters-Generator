She enjoys googling tongue twisters and repeating them without considering if they are appropriate for her age or too challenging as a non-native speaker of those languages! This inspired me to create this app for her and anyone of any age to have funâ€”whether solo or in a group setting, taking turns! I hope you enjoy this Tongue Twister App as much as we do! And to make it more fun, all these tongue twisters were voice dubbed by my daughter, which makes this fun app more close to my heart!";
